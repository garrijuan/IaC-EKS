**Infraestructure As Code - IaC**

in this repository, we work with infrastructure as code on a kubernetes cluster on AWS, we use two methods: terraform and cloudformation.

_Terraform_ is a standard language to work with infrastructure as code and standardize everything, although we will use our own modules to interact with AWS.

_CloudFormation_ on the other hand is proprietary to AWS and allows us to build infrastructure by applying different stacks within AWS.
